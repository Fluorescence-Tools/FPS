## Overview
The graphical user interface and libraries of the FRET Positioning System (Nature Methods in 2012).

FRET positioning refers to finding spatial positions and orientations of multiple structural subunits subject to a set of experimental FRET restraints. Each unit is assumed to have a known rigid structure. In addition to the restraints provided explicitly, clashes between subunits are taken into account. No other interactions (electrostatic, hydrophobic, ...) are considered. For comparable approaches see e.g. (Brunger et al, 2011) (also referred to as rigid body docking or rigid body MD).

FRET screening is a complementary method of "filtering" a structure library with respect to agreement with FRET data.

## Download

The original MS-Windows software (v1.1) can be found in the "release" folder.  This version was wrapped for the use on MacOS (tested in High Sierra 10.13.4).
